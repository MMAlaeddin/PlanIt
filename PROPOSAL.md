**Description**

A business planning application that allows entrepreneurs to create their proposal and bring their business to life!  The application will allow the user to follow along a step-by-step process of building a clean proposal for their next venture and future investors.  
Use Case
Starting a business is a very lengthy and tedious process that requires market research, cash management, operations, competitive analysis and future plans that your investors will need in order to decide the next steps for your business.  PlanIt will help you get your feet on the ground by walking you through the process of building your business on paper. 

PlanIt’s functionality will ask you the important questions that you will need to think about and walk you through inputting those answers into our proposal generator.  This gives a visual layout and the foundation of your business plan.  From there you will need some charts to present hard numbers, those numbers are what’s necessary for your investors.  How much money do you need?  What will you do with that money?  PlanIt will have a generator that will allow you to input numbers and text field to present those charts professionally, just make sure you do your math right! 

Another important factor of business planning and starting registrations are legal documents!  We have a central hub for you to find all the necessary documents you will need and a brief description on why you need them. 

**Use Case for Epicodus**

Starting a capstone project seems extremely intimidating!  We have to decide on a project, languages to use, MVP, research and building a proposal!  PlanIt will help alleviate some of this stress by helping you build your capstone proposal and make it look sleek!  
Aside from building your proposal with a simple form and answering some questions, you will also be able to create a checklist…or your favorite…..ToDoList!  The checklist will allow you to go over your progress and ensure you have your tasks and goals for your project completed.  


**Minimum Viable Product**

The MVP will include user registration and authentication.  User will have the ability to follow a process.  Once user clicks “Build my proposal,” it will direct them to our generator.  The user will follow along with a set of prompts to answer.  Once all of the prompts are completed the user will be able to view the introduction portion of their business proposal.  The intro will include Executive Summary, Business Description and Operations & Management Plan.  

The user will have a dashboard as well that includes links to legal documents they will need in order to start building their business in legal terms.

I will be building the overall backend with C#, Identity and JWT for security and authentication, and AngularJS, HTML, CSS, and HTML Helper for frontend.

Entrepreneur view will include business proposal input form, chart and graph creator, legal document hub that will make API calls to DocuSign API, checklist and contact list for potential investors, partners and referrals for future employees.
